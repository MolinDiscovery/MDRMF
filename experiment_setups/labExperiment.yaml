    # Using the chosen acquisition function the top X amount molecules are found.
    # If replicates is > 1 then the software will train and predict X times and print results
    # If replicates is > 1 and 'top_candidates: True' then the software will make
    # for example 10 trainings and predictions and count up which molecules was predicted the most.
    # At this point this is just an experimental idea.

    # It is possible to use either a featurizer and a ´SMILES_col: smiles_column_name´
    # However, it is also to use a pre-computed vector if given the ´vector_col: vector_column_name´ keyword
    # If given a SMILES_col a featurizer must be provided.
